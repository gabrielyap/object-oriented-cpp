I found out that copyij runs faster than copyji. For copyij, I got an
average real time of 0.039s for each run. For copyji, I got an average
real time of 0.158s for each run. This difference in the speed of run
time is due to the fact that ij makes the rows first, which makes it easier
for the computer to store memory addresses in comparison to ji, which
creates columns first.
