This is just a **** reference **** implementation.

The followings are included --

Makefile
all the *.h files
test JSON files
The JvTime class
(BTW, I modified the MyTime struct from the demo video to make it a C++ class,
 called JvTime, Json Value Time class. I included both JvTime.h and JvTime.cpp)

I also included three other .cpp files so you can see how I did the dumpJ functions (and how I used
the JvTime objects) --

Person.cpp (plus Core.cpp)
Reaction.cpp
Comment.cpp
